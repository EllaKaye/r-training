We will work on a single branch, with the default name of `main`.  \n\n## Staging and committing\n\nVersions are created in a _commit_.\n\nWe prepare the commit by _staging_ changes we want to record:\n\n * _Untracked_ files (git treats the whole content as new)\n * _Tracked_ files that have been modified or deleted since the last commit\n \nThink of it like taking photographs: we stage the scene by adding/removing people, or changing people's outfits, when we have a scene we want to save we take a photograph.\n\n# GitHub {background-color=\"#552D62\"}\n\n## git + Github\n\n:::: {.columns}\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\nThe full power comes by connecting a local repo to GitHub. \n\n - You can make changes locally and _push_ them to GitHub\n - You can make changes via the GitHub website and later _pull_ them into your local copy.\n - Collaborators can also push/pull changes to the repo.\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../images/how_github_works.png){fig-align='center' fig-alt='Diagram showing arrows to and from your repo and a central remote repo (GitHub).

Add some content to the README and commit - try some new markdown syntax, e.g. emoji or a table.\n\n* [Build a stunning README for your GitHub profile](https://towardsdatascience.com/build-a-stunning-readme-for-your-github-profile-9b80434fe5d7)\n\n# Configuring git and GitHub {background-color=\"#552D62\"}\n\n## Using git locally\n\nCheck if you already have git by running the following command in a terminal (e.g. Terminal tab on RStudio).\n\nOn MacOS/Linux (or Windows with Rtools)\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.sh .cell-code}\nwhich git\n```\n:::\n\n\nOn Windows\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.sh .cell-code}\nwhere git\n```\n:::\n\n\nMacOS: If asked to install the Xcode command line tools, say yes - this will install git.\n\n## Installing git\n\nWindows: \n\n - Use the installer from https://git-scm.com/downloads\n - Check RStudio can find the git executable\n \n     - Go to Tools > Global Options > Git/SVN to check\n     - Restart RStudio before trying to use git\n     \nLinux:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.sh .cell-code}\nsudo apt-get install git\n```\n:::\n\nor\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.sh .cell-code}\nsudo yum install git\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Configure git (globally)\n\nSet the default name and email to associate with your git commits:\n\n```r\nlibrary(usethis)\nuse_git_config(\n  user.name = \"Ada Lovelace\",     # your full name\n  user.email = \"ada@example.com\"  # email associated with GitHub account\n  )\n```\n\nTo keep your email private:\n\n   - Go to <https://github.com/settings/emails>, select “Keep my email address private” and “Block command line pushes that expose my email” options\n   - Configure git to use the address provided of the form <ID+username@users.noreply.github.com>\n   \n## Authentication\n\nGitHub requires authentication with a Personal Access Token or SSH key.\n\n| SSH keys                | PAT                 |\n|-------------------------|---------------------|\n| More setup (on Windows) | **usethis** helpers |\n| Once per computer+host  | Renew every 30 days (recommended) |\n| Need for HPC            | Need for **usethis**/other R packages |\n\nRecommend: PAT now (easier), SSH later if needed\n\n## Main recommendations\n\nFrom {usethis} vignette [Managing Git(Hub) Credentials](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/git-credentials.html)\n\nOur main recommendations are:\n\n  - Adopt HTTPS as your Git transport protocol.\n  - Turn on two-factor authentication for your GitHub account.\n  - Use a personal access token (PAT) for all Git remote operations from the command line or from R.\n  - Allow tools to store and retrieve your credentials from the Git credential store. If you have previously set your GitHub PAT in .Renviron, stop doing that.\n\n*Highly recommend reading this entire vignette and following all guidance*\n\n## sitrep and vaccinate\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(usethis) # make sure > v2.0.0\ngit_sitrep() # current situation report\ngit_vaccinate() # add files to global .gitignore (best practice)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Get a personal access token (PAT)\n\nFirst, make sure you're signed into GitHub\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncreate_github_token()\n```\n:::\n\n\n- Add Note describing use-case (e.g. personal-macbook-pro-2021, project-xyz)\n- Select expiration (recommend default 30 days)\n- Check scope\n- Click 'Generate Token'\n- **Important!** Copy token to clipboard, do not close window until stored!\n- You may want to store token in a secure vault, like 1Passward\n\n## Put your PAT into the local Git credential store\n\nAssume token is on your clipboard\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngitcreds::gitcreds_set()\n```\n:::\n\n\n- If you don't have a PAT stored, will prompt you to enter: paste!\n- If you do, you will be given a choice to keep/replace/see the password\n  - choose as appropriate\n  - if replacing, paste!\n  \n## PAT maintenance\n\n- By default token will expire after 30 days.\n- Return to ,https://github.com/settings/tokens. and click on its *Note*\n  - or else click on link in e-mail telling you token is about to expire!\n- Regenerate token\n- rerun `gitcreds::gitcreds_set()`\n\nA bit of a pain to do this every month, but only takes a couple of minutes.\n\n## Your turn!\n\nIf you need to, generate and store a PAT, as described over last few slides and in the [vignette](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/git-credentials.html).\n\nIf you already have a PAT set, read the vignette and follow through on other best pracice recommendations.\n\n## Create an RStudio project from a GitHub repo\n\nNow you can clone your GitHub repo locally.\n\n- Go to your repo homepage on GitHub. Click the green \"Code\" button, copy the HTTPS address (of the form `https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO.git`).\n\n- In RStudio, go to File > New Project… > Version Control > Git.\n\n  - Enter the repo URL you just copied. The project directory name will be filled automatically.\n  - Browse to a location you want the project directory to be created.\n  - Click `Create Project`.\n\n## Summary\n\n- Working openly encourages good practices\n- Your code/software is an asset!\n- We can make steps to improve our own practice\n\n# End Matter {background-color=\"#552D62\"}\n\n## Resources\n\nMaterial inspired by and remixed from:\n\n- \n\n## License\n\nLicensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License ([CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/){target=\"_blank\"}).\n",
